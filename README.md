## VaultGuard

VaultGuard is an advanced Web3 security framework that provides real-time threat detection and analysis for blockchain transactions. Using AI-powered analysis and community intelligence, VaultGuard protects users from scams, malicious contracts, and various blockchain threats.

## Features

* Real-time Transaction Analysis - Instant security analysis of incoming/outgoing transactions
* AI-Generated Security Code - Dynamic analysis algorithms generated by AI for each transaction type
* Edge Learning Engine - Cached intelligence for instant threat detection without delays
* Community Threat Intelligence - Shared blacklists and scam patterns across the community
* Multi-Chain Support - Currently supports Solana with extensible architecture
* Quarantine System - Automatic isolation of suspicious tokens and NFTs
* Background Intelligence - Continuous monitoring of social media and threat feeds
* API Integration - Easy integration with wallet providers and security tools

## Architecture

VaultGuard consists of two main components:

* agent/ - Core security analysis engine with AI-powered threat detection
* rag-api/ - Vector database and knowledge retrieval system for threat intelligence
* db/ - Local database storage for analysis results and cached intelligence

## Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)
* AI API Keys (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or OpenRouter)
* Solana RPC Access (Helius, QuickNode, or public RPC)

### Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:

"""
git clone <https://github.com/ticketguy/vaultguard.git>
cd vaultguard
"""

2. Run the setup script:

"""
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh
"""

3. Configure environment variables:

"""

# Copy and edit environment files

cp agent/.env.example agent/.env
cp rag-api/.env.example rag-api/.env

# Edit the .env files with your API keys

"""

### Manual Setup

1. Set up Python virtual environment:

"""

# Create and activate virtual environment

python -m venv agent-venv
source agent-venv/bin/activate

# Install agent dependencies

cd agent
pip install -e .
cd ..
"""

2. Set up RAG API:

"""

# Install RAG API dependencies

cd rag-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
"""

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Start Components Individually

Terminal 1 - Start RAG API:

"""
cd rag-api
python scripts/api.py
"""

Terminal 2 - Start Security Agent:

"""
cd agent
python scripts/starter.py
"""

The security agent will guide you through an interactive setup process where you can:

* Choose your AI model (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
* Enable/disable background monitoring
* Configure edge learning engine
* Set up wallet integration API

### Method 2: Docker Compose

Start the complete system:

"""
docker compose up --build
"""

Services will be available at:

* RAG API: <http://localhost:8080>
* Security Agent API: <http://localhost:8001>
* Agent Dashboard: <http://localhost:9009>

### Security Agent Configuration

VaultGuard uses agent/starter/security.json for advanced configuration:

"""
{
  "agent_id": "vaultguard_production",
  "model": "claude",
  "role": "Real-time Solana blockchain security monitor",
  "network": "solana",
  "research_tools": ["Solana RPC", "Threat Intelligence", "DuckDuckGo"],
  "metric_name": "security"
}
"""

## Usage

### Interactive Security Analysis

Once started, VaultGuard provides an interactive interface for:

1. Real-time Transaction Monitoring - Analyzes transactions as they happen
2. Wallet Security Assessment - Comprehensive security analysis of wallet addresses  
3. Threat Intelligence Sharing - Report and query community threat data
4. Custom Security Policies - Configure quarantine and blocking rules

### API Integration

Analyze a transaction:

"""
curl -X POST <http://localhost:8001/api/v1/analyze> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_data": {
      "from_address": "...",
      "to_address": "...",
      "amount": 1000000,
      "token_mint": "..."
    }
  }'
"""

Response:

"""
{
  "action": "ALLOW",
  "risk_score": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "user_explanation": "Transaction appears safe",
  "threat_categories": [],
  "analysis_time_ms": 45
}
"""
